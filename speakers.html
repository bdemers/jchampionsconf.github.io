                  <p>Rapid Prototyping is an approach to software development that emphasizes quick, iterative development cycles and minimal feature sets. The goal in rapid prototyping is not to develop a product. The goal is to, as quickly as possible, build something that utilizes a technology or platform to the point that you can understand the strengths and weaknesses of that technology or platform.
This is where Rapid Prototyping is most valuable. Rather than picking one platform to heavily invest in, perhaps for years to come, Rapid Prototyping allows you to integrate a proof of concept on each platform to see exactly how they perform in different scenarios. You may spend a sprint or two upfront doing that work, but you may save months switching platforms down the road.
Rapid Prototyping is the best way to develop digital products for your business. I'll walk you through a real-world case study, a concrete example from our time working with the Innovation team at West Elm.

                  <p>Our industry is rather amnesic. Today, most young Java developers ignore what happened during the early 2000’s that led us with the frameworks and tools we are using today.
That’s too bad because this knowledge would help them to be better developers by understanding the long and winding road, we went thru during these last 20 years.
<br/>
In this session I’ll go back on the major events of this story with a trolling level at the minimum possible.
<br/>
We will travel in time to understand the EJB curse and see the Spring 1.0 birth. Then we’ll explain EJB 3.0 reinvention, CDI emergence and Spring Boot launch.
The temporary end of the story will lead us to talk about MicroProfile, Quarkus and Spring Native.
<br/>
During our journey we’ll try to understand the naming malediction that turned J2EE in Java EE and then Jakarta EE (and no, JEE doesn’t exists). We’ll also try to explore most Spring attempt to build a profitable business model.
<br/>
At the end of this talk you should have a better overview of the Java Enterprise ecosystem and understand why you should remove J2EE or Java EE (and of course JEE) from your CV if you only are a Spring expert.

                  <p>This talk shows you how to produce telemetry from your Java services using an open standard to retain control of data. OpenTelemetry allows you to instrument your application code through vendor-neutral APIs, libraries, and tools. It provides the tools necessary for you to gain visibility into the performance of your services and overall latency.

In this session, Anton introduces OpenTelementry and what's the current status in Java. He will show some real examples and all the required resources to start taking advantage of OpenTelemetry to monitor Java applications.

                  <p>We've all heard the hype: Quantum computers will leave our current machines wallowing in the dust. Quantum algorithms will crack our existing encryption schemes in seconds. Will it really happen? The answer depends on engineering problems that have yet to be solved. But for those of us who write code, many insights are already available. In this session, I'll run Java code from Johan Vos's Quantum Computing in Action book. I'll use the code to describe how quantum algorithms approach problems.

                  <p>We don’t have to exert much mental effort when writing blocking code, but this has drawbacks. Non-blocking code, on the other hand, could be used to increase application throughput. This is why non-blocking code is recommended in many scenarios. Over the last two decades, many approaches have been introduced to writing code that does not block.
<br/><br/>
In this session, we will look into those options that are available to us. To begin, I’ll go over the evolution of the Java concurrency model since its inception with the vanilla thread. Then I will introduce Future/Callable, and CompletableFuture, briefly go over reactive programming, and finally conclude with the Project Loom that was added in Java 19.

The original 12 factor app methodology helped to lay out some of the key characteristics needed for cloud-native applications... but... as our cloud infrastructure and tooling has progressed, so too have these factors. <br/>
In this session we'll dive into the extended and updated 15 factors needed to build cloud native applications that are able to thrive in this environment, and we'll take a look at open source technologies and tools that can help us achieve this.

                <p>"Just leave the garbage outside and we will take care of it for you". This is the panacea promised by garbage collection mechanisms built into most software stacks available today. So, we don’t need to think about it anymore, right? Wrong! When misused, garbage collectors can fail miserably. When this happens they slow down your application and lead to unacceptable pauses. In this talk we will go over different garbage collectors approaches and understand under which conditions they function well.

                <p>The code we write has a climate impact. But how big is that impact? How do we measure it? How do we reduce it? Is the cloud helping? What’s going on with Virginia? Are we still allowed to do CI/CD? Will native compilation save us? Is Java even a good choice anymore? This talk discusses some of the trade-offs for a modern software developer, and provides a roadmap to figuring out the right thing.

                <p>Apache Maven is an ubiquitous build tool in the Java ecosystem, some even claim it's the defacto standard build tool. Configuring Maven is deceptively simple, after all it's just a matter of writing XML, isn't it? Things look differently when the rubber meets the road. One must know the intricacies of the build lifecycle; how plugins, goals (mojos), and phases come together; rules for dependency resolution; configuration inheritance between parent - child POM files; enhancing the build with profiles; and more. These features may trip you over if the rules that govern them are unclear. We'll present a series of scenarios to test your knowledge on Maven rules. we guarantee you'll leave this session with a few bits of new information and better understanding of the Maven build tool.

                <p>The JVM comes with more than 700 configurations. With all of these options, it can quickly become confusing as to which configurations you should set and how. Getting JVM configurations right with a container in the mix is enough to drive even the best of us mad. In this session, we'll explore memory and other settings that can have a significant impact on the performance and stability of your Java application. We'll also look at how to blend sensible JVM and container configurations.

                <p>A year ago I started with a couple of friends a new project to create a visual editor for integrations: based on a visual drag and drop selection on building blocks, generate deployable source code.
<br/>
As responsible of the backend side, I obviously chose Java to do it. Some of the challenges were to have an extendable and customizable core where we could inject module languages to generate different outputs depending on how the user wanted to deploy. We also wanted to customize the catalog of building blocks to dynamically adapt to each user. Coming from the Java 8 world with shy traces of Java 11, I decided to jump directly to Quarkus on Java 17 and explore the serverless possibilities while, at the same time, keep the over-engineering and the over-fanciness of new features as reasonable as possible.
<br/>
On this talk I will describe the bowels of Kaoto.io, the journey we had to implement a stable architecture, and how it evolved into the powerful tool it is now. I will discuss about the technologies used, their shortcomings and their black magic; and why the decisions made were the right ones (or not!).
<br/>
This is a good talk if you want to see Quarkus in a real use case.

                <p>Virtual threads will be very likely the next big game changer in the Java ecosystem, allowing to have the scalability of asynchronous programming models with the simplicity of synchronous code. Their main claim is that, differently from native threads that are a costly and then scarce resource, you can create as many virtual threads as you want with known and much cheaper memory and performance impact than the native ones. But is this always true? What are the costs of scheduling thousands or even millions of virtual threads? Does the more frequent context switch have some performance implications? What about the cache misses that these context switches could potentially imply? During this talk we will try to answer these questions in a funny way, by analyzing an implementation of the traditional Conway's Game of Life based on the communicating sequential processes (CSP) model and using both virtual and native threads with different algorithms in order to compare their performances. Based on this analysis we will also try to derive some rules of thumb on when and how using virtual threads.

                <p>The world is moving at an unprecedented pace and much of it has been powered by the innovations in software and systems. While event handling, messaging, and processing are not necessarily brand new concepts, the recent emergence in hardware such as virtualizations, multi-core processors, and so on, are in fact pushing the envelope in software design and development, elevating it to higher levels of capabilities never seen before. In the case of streaming which very often leverages on the underlying messaging mechanism(s) to bring distributed messaging to higher forms of purposes, such as IoT/IIoT applications, AI/ML data pipelines, or even eCommerce recommendations, event streaming platform has indeed become the "glue" in enabling data to flow through disparate systems in the pipeline and in a very dynamic fashion.
<br/>
This talk on event streaming is meant for anyone interested in learning about it, and understanding how it fits into the modern software development design and architecture, as well as seeing some of the challenges it faces especially in the Cloud Native environment. We’ll then take a look at an open source platform - Apache Pulsar, which is poised to become the de facto new generation of distributed messaging and streaming platform that will bring joy to developers, and enable systems and applications to be highly responsive with its true real-time capabilities.

                <p>For years, we’ve been told that Java suffers from cold starts in AWS Lambda and Serverless in general. Believe it not. Java is extremely fast to start, the simplest Java program starts in milliseconds. It’s the Java frameworks and libraries that slow things down in general. But not all of them…
<br/>
In this session, I want to show you the truth about Serverless Java and cold starts, what’s slow, what’s fast and why it matters. We’ll go through what a cold start is, how cold starts in AWS Lambda impact your application responsiveness and cloud costs, and what are the options to optimize both. We’ll explore and compare Quarkus and Piranha Cloud, the most modern and fastest Jakarta EE frameworks. We’ll test the limits of what they are capable of, how fast they start and whether we even need to think about any optimizations. Then I’ll explain what optimizations may help if you need to go further, like tuning the JVM, using a custom JVM runtime or building a OS-native binary with GraalVM. However, there are also a few limitations and cost implications of these optimizations, which we'll also explain.
<br/>
I’ll show and tell, with very few slides. You’ll see live for yourselves how Java AWS Lambda functions built with Jakarta EE can start fast and decrease the cold starts to the absolute minimum which you can barely notice

                <p>Persistence is the soul of modern architecture. It is a way to have a state in the stateless application, mainly in distributed systems such as microservices and cloud age app style.
<br/>
We handle various persistence sources such as SQL, NoSQL, or even web services. With a considerable amount of options or flavors, how can we have a business away from these details or have a loose couple between the application and the persistence engine?
<br/>
This presentation will discuss the new trends in the modern persistence model around enterprise architecture.

                <p>Up to 4 CPUs, allocations are cheap, GC is pretty cheap.
However, 4 busy CPUs may be enough to saturate your server's memory bus. Using more CPUs may result in little to no benefit unless you consider the total allocation rate of the physical server.
In this talk, I look at how to test this and a simple estimate of how much throughput is consumed by your allocations.
<br/>
Virtual machines don't provide isolated use of the memory buses, allowing one 4 vCPU VM to slow all others on the same physical machine significantly, so it's essential to understand its impact.

                <p>Do you fear missing the Serverless/Microservices/DDD/Reactive/GitOps era? You're not alone. Despite hyped technologies, not everyone is working at a FAANG and many consultants out-there struggle to modernize well-established development teams culture, technology and process. This talk presents a generic approach used in two mid-sized government institutions (500+ employees) running projects in Java and NodeJS. Describing how these institutions were evaluated, trained, and most importantly how DDD, Reactive, GitOps, Kubernetes . . . makes sense (or not) in this kind of context. Presenting the current results and how developer's life improved (or not) by reducing technical debt.
